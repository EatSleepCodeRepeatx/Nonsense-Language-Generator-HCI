                  Command-Line-App


SYNOPSIS:

                  Generator <options> [--library library] [--outfile outfile] [--c count] [--m mode] [--generate generate]
                                      [--help help] [--version version] [--html -t]
                                      [-l library] [-o outfile] [-c count] [-m mode] [-g generate] [-v version]
                                      [-v version] [-t html]


DESCRIPTION:      This program is a tool used in generate the blocks of nonsense text via two built-in libraries, and
                  generated text might or might be legible to the human reader in some case since all the texts are
                  completely generate randomly. In term of execution of program, user is able to execute this program
                  in two different modes, which are command line more and interactive mode respectively. Command line
                  mode, which is started by default if there isn't special command made by user to enforce the program
                  to be switch into second mode. The interactive mode is quiet reflexive, when user runs the program
                  under this mode, user doesn't have to obey as much as syntax rule of language as in the command line
                  mode, it is relative easy to used.




		          Interactive mode and Command Line Mode

		          Interactive mode is not support following command --generate, --help, --version, argument will be
                  passed through set command when program is called, and it is easier to be used. For the command line
                  mode, Although it is executed by default and only runs one time, but user must have to obey certain
		          rules to make program work smoothly under this mode, every input command user entered must to started
		          with generator in order to produce appropriate text, user also need to be aware of the standalone
		          commands, they can't be used with other command, for more information, please refer to option page of
		          the manuel page.



OPTIONS:

                 Command Line Mode


                 --help, -h                    The command produce a description of the generator program along with
                                               instruction on how to use different synopsis to generate desired output,
                                               and what each command can do in the program.


                 --version,-v                  The command allows user to check the current version of the application.



                 --library, -l <library>       The command specifies the source of the nonsense language being generated,
                                               the default library is lorem, if not anguish is not being called


                 --outfile, -o <filename>      This command specifies the output file that the generated text will be
                                               written to, if this command is not being specified, the generated text
                                               will be written to console, and output file must to have .txt extension,
                                               else, the format of output file is not acceptable


                 --mode, -m <mode>             This command specifies the output mode of generated language, there are
                                               three mode are allowed in this program, which are paragraph, word, bullet
                                               respectively. The mode of language will be set to paragraph if no mode
                                               are specified

                 --count, -c <count>           This command allows you to specify number of time that you want our program
                                               to generate the txt, if the count is not defined, then the program will
                                               assigned a parameter to it by default based on language mode, so 1 for
                                               paragraph, 3 for word, and 5 for bullet

                 --html, -t                    This command will sorted and enclosed the generated text with HTML format,
                                               paragraph will be enclosed in <p> tag, <h1> for word, and <ul> and <ui>
                                               for bullet


                 --generate, -g                The command is needed to be included to run the program in the command line
                                               mode, else, the program will be run in the interactive mode



                 Interactive mode

                 generate <options>            This command line is same as above, but run in different mode



                 help                          Same as above



                 version                       Same as above

                 set<option> <value>           This command allows the user to specify a default value for mode,
                 		                       count, library,html, and outfile. So when the command is called,
                 		                       program will automatically write in these value, if you are not
                 		                       going to specify another value to overwrite it

                 show<option>                  This command allows you to inspect the current value of the command, if
                 		                       it has one, else, the program will show all the command whose current
                 		                       value has been defined


                 exit, quit                    Exits the program






BUGS
                 Tab completion is not working and interactive mode have not been implemented
